# folder-bomb
A piece of malware that spams random folders in a given directory, can be edited and tweaked to do some more stuff.

It's easy to use. You can use it on remote clients with netcat.

    gcc folder-bomb.c++

Or if you are using a Linux environment, just use the Python version.

    python folder-bomb.py
